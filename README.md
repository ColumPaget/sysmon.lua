This is just a simple lua script that displays some stats, particularly cpu speeds and temperatures, for machines that are accessed via ssh or otherwise don't have a gui to display xosview or the like.

Currently there are no command-line options, you just run it and get the status display. Control-C to stop it.

This program requires you to have libUseful and libUseful-lua installed on your system.
